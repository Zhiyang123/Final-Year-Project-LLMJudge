"""
Returns a classification verification prompt template based on the given injection class.

Parameters:
injection_class (str): The category of the prompt injection attack, represented by a letter (A-J).

Returns:
str: A formatted prompt template that asks whether the given prompt is correctly classified under the specified injection class.

Each injection class corresponds to a predefined security-related prompt category, including:
- Virtualization-Class (A)
- Passive Injection (B)
- User-Driven Injection (C)
- Adversarial Suffix Injection (D)
- Payload Splitting Injection (E)
- Active Injection (F)
- Double Character Injection (G)
- Obfuscation Injection (H)
- Instruction Manipulation Injection (I)
- Virtual Prompt Injection (J)
